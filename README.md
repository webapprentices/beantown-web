<p>The mission of <strong><a href="https://beantownweb.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Beantown Web</a></strong> is to provide information about web development training and career opportunities in the Boston metro area.</p>

<p>Starting in 2005, I have published more than 400 articles on a range of topics related to technology and career development. I have settled in on two areas of interest: <strong><a href="https://beantownweb.blogspot.com/search/label/jobs" target="_nblank">Boston Web Tech Job Market</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://beantownweb.blogspot.com/search/label/books" target="_blank">Best Business Books</a></strong>.</p>

<p>This repository holds code written for articles published on <strong>Beantown Web</strong>.</p>
